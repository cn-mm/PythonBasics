Intermediate Python Programming
1. Efficiency and scalability
2. Maintainability
3. Modularity (generalisation)

import this - The Zen of Python

n1. join scales better, uses less processing
n2. import os to access files not in directory

Command line interfaces (CLI)
cron : cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems.
       Users that set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule
       jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.

import argparse - this module is used to write command line interfaces.
                  The program defines arguments required and argparse figures out how to parse them

import sys - this module (System-specific parameters and functions) provides access to
             some variables used or maintained by the interpreter
