# PythonBasics
Coding Implementations from Python Basics and Intermediate series by [Sentdex](https://pythonprogramming.net/)

This is a part of the training programme for my summer intern.
The two tutorials I will be following are listed as follows:
1. [Learning to program with Python 3 (py 3.7)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeAams7fkdcwOGBpGdHpXln)
2. [Intermediate Python Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfju7ADVp5W1GF9jVhjbX-_)

Credit for the tutorials: Sentdex (his tutorials are brilliant). 

Furthermore, the directory OpenCV corresponds to the following tutorial series (also by Harrison):
[OpenCV with Python](https://pythonprogramming.net/loading-images-python-opencv-tutorial/)

Web_Scraper directory contains my attempt at learning Web Scraping and making a Google Images Web Scrapper from scratch using Beautiful Soup and Selenium.
